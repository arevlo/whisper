## Troubleshooting

1. **If you have microphone issues**:
   - Check your system's sound settings to ensure your microphone is set as the default input device
   - Increase microphone volume in system settings
   - Try a different microphone if available

2. **If transcription quality is poor**:
   - Use a more powerful model (`--model medium` or `--model large`)
   - Speak more clearly and avoid background noise
   - Position the microphone closer to your mouth

3. **If the script takes too long to transcribe**:
   - Use a smaller model (`--model tiny` or `--model base`)
   - Reduce the recording duration (`--duration 3`)

4. **If keyboard module gives you errors**:
   - On Windows, try running the command prompt as administrator
   - On macOS/Linux, you may need additional permissions for keyboard monitoring

## Notes

- The script creates temporary audio files that are deleted after transcription
- Press Ctrl+C to stop the dictation process at any time
- In interactive mode, your microphone selection and settings are preserved between recordings
- Spacebar mode is perfect for dictation as it gives you precise control of when recording starts and stops
- The Windows clipboard integration makes it easy to paste anywhere
